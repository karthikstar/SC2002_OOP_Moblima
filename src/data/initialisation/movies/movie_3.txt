Produced by award-winning filmmaker Anthony Chen. Auntie (Hong Huifang), is a middle-aged Singaporean woman who has dedicated the best years of her life to caring for her family. Now widowed with her grown up son, Sam (Shane Pow) about to fly the roost, Auntie is left to contend with a whole new identity beyond her roles of daughter, wife, and mother. A solo trip to Korea becomes a wild adventure for Auntie, where she meets Kwon-Woo (Kang Hyung Suk), a young tour guide who can’t seem to get his life in order, and Jung Su (Jung Dong-Hwan), an elderly security guard. The trio embark on an unexpected roller coaster ride where hearts flutter and unlikely bonds are formed. Inspired by the director’s mother, AJOOMMA is the story of a woman’s journey of self-discovery, where Auntie learns to embrace her new independent life with renewed confidence and panache.
