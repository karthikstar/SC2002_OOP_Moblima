Everyone is called “Anne” and they are all being chased! We challenge you to prove your bravery in a movie that will awaken all your senses in order to survive. In Faces of Anne, Anne takes you on a terrifying mystery journey with secrets lurking in the dark corners. When all the girls named "Anne" wakes up with fuzzy memories which the doctors and nurses keep injecting and saying it is mental symptoms that they think to themselves, along with hypnosis to make them remember who they are. Not too long ago in this mental ward, every time Anne opens her eyes, every time Anne dies, or every time Anne's face changes, the young women in this place begin to mysteriously disappear. Fear gradually began to take root in the minds of the survivors. Until they encountered the legendary deer-headed demon "Wedigo". The only way is to piece together the past and the mysteries that lead to the truth and to find a way to escape in time before death takes them away.
