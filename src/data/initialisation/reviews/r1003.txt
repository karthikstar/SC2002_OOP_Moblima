Abominable
Kristen Page-Kirby 
‘Abominable’ is adorable. The story may be standard, but the film is a visual delight.
As cliched as it sounds, there’s no reason to reinvent the wheel. But if a wheel can’t be improved on, it can be made lovelier. That’s what “Abominable” does. The animated film takes a standard story and adds so much visual beauty that it exceeds expectations. First, that standard story: Yi (voice of Chloe Bennet) is a Shanghai teenager, still grieving the recent death of her father; she suppresses her sadness by keeping busy with various jobs and distancing herself from her mother and grandmother (Michelle Wong and Tsai Chin ). After one particular frenetic day, she escapes to her rooftop sanctuary, where she finds a yeti who’s escaped from a zoologist (Sarah Paulson) and a rare animal collector (Eddie Izzard). Yi and the yeti, whom she names Everest, head off to the Himalayas to return the creature to his home, accompanied by two friends, who are mostly there to provide exposition.
